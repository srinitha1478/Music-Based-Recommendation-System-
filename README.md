Project Description

The Mood-Based Music Recommendation System is designed to enhance the music listening experience by recommending songs that match the user’s current emotional state. Instead of relying only on traditional factors such as playlists or genres, this system focuses on understanding the user’s mood and delivering personalized music suggestions accordingly.

The system analyzes user inputs, such as voice, text, or predefined mood selections, to identify emotional states like happiness, sadness, calmness, anger, or excitement. Based on the detected mood, the system recommends suitable songs or playlists that align with the user’s emotional preferences, creating a more engaging and emotionally connected listening experience.

 Objectives

To detect or identify the user’s current mood accurately

To recommend music that aligns with the detected emotional state

To improve user satisfaction through personalized music suggestions

To reduce manual effort in searching for mood-appropriate music

🛠️ System Overview

The system consists of a mood detection module and a music recommendation module. The mood detection component interprets user input to classify emotional states, while the recommendation component maps the detected mood to a curated set of songs or playlists. This approach allows the system to deliver dynamic and context-aware music recommendations.
